# Show Calendar

For a fun project for practice and to learn React, I'm making a grid style calendar that includes live concerts / events / whatever else I come up with.

Right now, I have a working calendar that let's a user click to change the month or year to fill in the month's days.

Below are the features / user stories I've come up with so far.  I'll try to flesh them out as I get better clarity and details on what needs to be done.  

..* grid style calendar that shows the concerts for each day.  Use an API like songkick to get data from.
..* the calendar shows concerts for the user's selected city.  
..* users get to build out their own calendar specific to their profile / account.
..* i.e. a user gets a blank calendar, then fills it in with concerts they are interested in.   

# Tools I'm using (so far):

* React, JSX, Webpack, es6, Babel

I'm also thinking I'll use Express and MongoDB for the back end.
